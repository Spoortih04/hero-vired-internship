SQL JOINs – Combine Data from Multiple Tables
Definition:
A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column, typically a foreign key.

 1. INNER JOIN
Returns only the matching rows from both tables.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
INNER JOIN courses ON students.course_id = courses.id;
 Only students who are enrolled in a course will appear.

 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the left table, and the matching ones from the right.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
LEFT JOIN courses ON students.course_id = courses.id;
 All students will appear—even if they’re not enrolled in any course (NULL for course_name).

 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the right table, and the matching ones from the left.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN courses ON students.course_id = courses.id;
 All courses will appear—even if no students are enrolled.

 4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
FULL OUTER JOIN courses ON students.course_id = courses.id;
 Includes all students and all courses—even if there’s no match.

 5. CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product – every row of the first table is joined with every row of the second.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
CROSS JOIN courses;
If 5 students and 3 courses: 5 × 3 = 15 results.
