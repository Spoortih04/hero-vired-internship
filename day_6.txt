SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data in databases.
 
Basic SQL Query Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE age > 18;
Explanation:

SELECT: Used to fetch data

name, age: Columns to retrieve

FROM students: From the "students" table

WHERE age > 18: Condition to filter rows



 SQL Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE age > 18;
ðŸ”¸ Detailed Breakdown:
SELECT

This is the keyword used to tell the database that you want to retrieve data.

It is always followed by the column names you want to display.

name, age

These are the specific columns you want to retrieve data from.

You can list as many column names as needed, separated by commas.

You can also use * to select all columns:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM students;
FROM students

This part tells the database which table to look into.

In this case, the table is called students.

WHERE age > 18

The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

Only the rows where the age is greater than 18 will be shown.

You can use other operators too:

=, != (or <>), <, <=, >, >=

AND, OR, NOT

LIKE for pattern matching

IN, BETWEEN, etc.

ðŸ”¸ Additional Examples:
Filter with multiple conditions:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name FROM students WHERE age > 18 AND gender = 'Male';
Using ORDER BY to sort results:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE age > 18 ORDER BY age DESC;
Using LIMIT to restrict number of rows:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name FROM students LIMIT 5;
